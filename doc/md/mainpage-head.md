Task-Motion Kit {#mainpage}
==============

The Task-Motion Kit (TMKit) is a framework for Task and Motion
Planning.  Everyday activities, e.g., setting a table or making
coffee, combine discrete decisions about objects and actions with
geometric decisions about collision free motion.  TMKit jointly
reasons about task-level objectives, i.e., choosing actions and
objects, and motion-level objectives, i.e., finding collision free
paths.
